Welcome to Defend Rest Attack Counter Steal (DRACS)!


--ABOUT THE GAME--
DRACS was developed for sole teaching/learning experience.
I was inspired by a Rock Paper Scissors algorithm where the opponent used machine learning algorithms to predict the player's move based off choice patterns.
This game does provide the user with the choice of playing against another player, or against the default AI.
DRACS employs machine learning algorithms to predict the move the move from a set number of the previous moves played by the player.


--HOW TO PLAY--
In this game, the main goal is defeating the opponent.
By default, both players start with 5 health points (hp) and 0 mana points (mp).
You cannot go over 5 hp, and 3 mp. Neither can you go in the negatives.
Every turn, both players make their choice of action amongst the five that make up DRACS (more below).
The game ends when either player falls to 0 hp, or after 20 turns (by default).


--HOW TO WIN--
Simple, defeat the opponent before you are bested.
If the allowable number of turns reach 0, the winner is decided on the following:
Each hp = 1 point
Each mp = 0.75 point
Whichever player has the greatest score sum will be the winner.


--ACTIONS--
DRACS has 5 main types of actions, each with their benefits and weakness.

***DEFEND***
DEFEND allows the user to block any incoming physical attacks.
On a successful block (i.e., the opponent decided to use ATTACK), the attacker will lose 1 mp and the user will not lose any hp.
If the opponent does not attack, nothing occurs.

HOWEVER, if the opponent uses STEAL, the user will lose 1 mp. If the user does not have any mp left, the opponent will instead steal 1 hp.
Make sure to balance DEFEND with other actions to prevent that from occuring.

***REST***
REST allows the user to gain 2 mp.

***ATTACK***
ATTACK allows the user to damage the opponent for 1 hp.
Be careful of COUNTER or STEAL.

***COUNTER***
COUNTER requires 1 mp to use, however when a successful counter occurs, the opponent will lose 1 hp instead.
COUNTER only works when the opponent uses ATTACK.

***STEAL***
STEAL is the main special ability in the game.
STEAL costs 3 mp to uses but will have a variety of effects depending on the opponent's action.

When using STEAL:
	IF the opponent uses DEFEND -> Steal 1 mp and gives it to the user's. IF the opponent does not have 1 mp, steal 1 hp instead.
	IF the opponent uses REST -> Steal 1 mp and 1 hp and add it to the user's.
	IF the opponent uses ATTACK -> Steal 1 hp from the opponent. The result is the opponent losing 1 hp, while the user remains at what they had. Can save from death.
	IF the opponent uses COUNTER -> Steal 1 mp and 1 hp and add it to the user's.
	IF the opponent uses STEAL -> Both nulify one another and nothing occurs.


--PARAMETERS--
The user can change the parameters of the game such as hp, mp, or number of turn in the parameter option at the start of the game.


--FUTURE--
If I find the time, I may modify the ML algorithm or add special opponents.
